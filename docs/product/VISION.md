# Product Vision: PUNCH⏰CLOCK Malaysia

## 1. The Problem
Malaysian SMEs (Small & Medium Enterprises) are trapped in an administrative nightmare.
*   **Attendance**: Tracking staff via WhatsApp groups or punch cards is prone to fraud ("Buddy Punching").
*   **Payroll**: Excel spreadsheets are error-prone and fail to keep up with complex LHDN/KWSP statutory calculations.
*   **Compliance**: Business owners unknowingly breach the Employment Act 1955 (e.g., OT limits, Friday prayer breaks), leading to fines.
*   **Cost**: Enterprise HR software (SAP, Workday) is too expensive and complex.

## 2. The Solution
**PUNCH⏰CLOCK** is a "Zero-Friction" HR Operating System. It combines consumer-grade UX (Neo-Brutalism) with enterprise-grade logic.

### Core Value Proposition
1.  **Hardware Agnostic**: Turns any iPad or cheap Android tablet into a biometric kiosk.
2.  **Compliance-First**: The system *knows* Malaysian law. It prevents illegal rosters and calculates taxes correctly.
3.  **AI-Agentic**: It doesn't just store data; it acts on it. It drafts warning letters, plans shifts, and audits risks.
4.  **Offline-First**: Designed for unstable internet environments (factories, retail basements).

## 3. Target Audience
*   **F&B Owners**: Cafes, Restaurants (High turnover, shift-based).
*   **Retail**: Boutiques, Convenience Stores.
*   **SME Offices**: Agencies, Consultancies (20-100 staff).

## 4. The "Neo-Brutalist" Philosophy
HR software is typically boring and grey. We chose **Neo-Brutalism** to make the mundane task of HR feel tactile, urgent, and modern. High contrast ensures readability in bright environments (kitchens, outdoors).
